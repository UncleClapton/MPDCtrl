# MPD-Ctrl

MPD Ctrl is a client app for the [MPD (Music player daemon)](http://www.musicpd.org/). It should also work with MPD-compatible servers such as [Mopidy](https://www.mopidy.com/) or [forked-daapd](http://ejurgensen.github.io/forked-daapd/). 
  
There are two flavors; **MPD Ctrl for Windows desktop**(WPF) and **MPD Ctrl for mobile cross-platform**(Xamarin.Forms).  

### MPD Ctrl for Windows desktop

### MPD Ctrl for mobile cross-platform
