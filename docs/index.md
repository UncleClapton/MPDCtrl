# MPDCtrl

MPDCtrl is a client app for the [MPD (Music player daemon)](http://www.musicpd.org/). It should also work with MPD-compatible servers such as [Mopidy](https://www.mopidy.com/) or [forked-daapd](http://ejurgensen.github.io/forked-daapd/). 
  
There are two flavors; **MPDCtrl for Windows desktop** (WPF) and **MPDCtrl for mobile cross-platform** (Xamarin.Forms).
